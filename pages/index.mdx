Paid resources are available for purchase on our [Tebex Store](https://project-penguins.tebex.io/). See [Terms of Service](/#terms-of-service).

Our paid resources may be encrypted by the CFX escrow system, and will be denoted so on the Tebex page. This means that the source code is not available, only configuration files and documentation. This is to prevent the unauthorized distribution of our paid resources. Even so, we strive to make our resources as customizable and integratable as possible out of the box for any framework.

The team may decide to sell open source versions of resources at any time as separate products.
